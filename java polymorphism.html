    <h1>Java Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Polymorphism</b> in Java means <u>one name, many forms</u>. 
      It allows the same method or operator to behave differently based on context. 
      There are two types: <em>compile-time (method overloading)</em> and <em>runtime (method overriding)</em>. 
      Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. 
      Method overriding lets a subclass <mark>redefine</mark> a method from its superclass. 
      Polymorphism improves <strong>code flexibility</strong>. 
      It helps implement <b>dynamic behavior</b> in programs. 
      Polymorphism is a key principle of <u>object-oriented programming</u>.
