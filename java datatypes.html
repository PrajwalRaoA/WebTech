    <h1>Java Variables</h1>
    <p>
      In <b>Java</b>, variables are used to <u>store data values</u> that can be used and modified later. 
      A variable has a <i>data type, name, and value</i>. 
      Java supports different types of variables such as <em>local, instance, and static variables</em>. 
      The data type determines what kind of value the variable can hold, like <mark>int, double, or String</mark>. 
      Variables must be declared before they are used in a program. 
      Using meaningful variable names improves code <b>readability and maintainability</b>. 
      Java also supports constants using the <strong>final</strong> keyword. 
      Proper use of variables is essential for writing <u>efficient Java programs</u>.
