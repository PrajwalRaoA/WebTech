<h1>Java Programming Language</h1>
      <p>
         <b>Java</b> is a popular <u>object-oriented programming language</u> 
         developed by <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong> in 1995. 
         It follows the principle of <i>Write Once, Run Anywhere</i>, 
         meaning Java code can run on any platform with a JVM. 
         Java is widely used for <em>web applications, mobile apps, and enterprise software</em>. 
         The language is known for its <mark>platform independence and security features</mark>. 
         Earlier versions of Java had support for <del>Applets</del>, 
         but now modern applications use frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. 
         Today, Java remains one of the most <b>powerful and versatile languages</b> in the world of programming.
