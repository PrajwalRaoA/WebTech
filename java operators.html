    <h1>Java Operators</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Operators</b> in Java are special symbols that perform <u>operations on variables and values</u>. 
      Java supports several types of operators such as <em>arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment</em>. 
      Arithmetic operators like <i>+, -, *, /</i> are used for mathematical calculations. 
      Relational operators like <mark>==, !=, >, <</mark> are used for comparisons. 
      Logical operators such as <strong>&&, ||, !</strong> are useful in conditional statements. 
      Assignment operators assign values to variables using symbols like <b>= or +=</b>. 
      Java also has unary and bitwise operators for advanced operations. 
      Operators make Java programs more <u>dynamic and functional</u>.
