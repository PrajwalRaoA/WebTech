    <h1>Java Classes and Objects</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Classes</b> and <b>objects</b> are the foundation of <u>object-oriented programming</u> in Java. 
      A class is a <em>blueprint</em> that defines properties and behaviors of an object. 
      An <i>object</i> is an instance of a class created using the <mark>new keyword</mark>. 
      Classes contain <strong>variables and methods</strong> that describe an object. 
      Objects allow <b>real-world modeling</b> in programming. 
      Multiple objects can be created from the same class. 
      The concept of encapsulation is achieved using classes. 
      They make Java programs more <u>modular and maintainable</u>.
