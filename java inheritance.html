    <h1>Java Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Inheritance</b> in Java is a mechanism where one class can <u>acquire properties of another class</u>. 
      The <em>extends</em> keyword is used to define inheritance. 
      It promotes <i>code reusability</i> by allowing new classes to use existing code. 
      The class being inherited is called the <mark>parent or superclass</mark>. 
      The class that inherits is called the <strong>child or subclass</strong>. 
      Inheritance allows <b>method overriding</b> for polymorphism. 
      Java supports <u>single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance</u>. 
      This makes Java applications more <em>organized and scalable</em>.
