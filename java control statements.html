    <h1>Java Control Statements</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Control statements</b> in Java allow the program to <u>make decisions and repeat tasks</u>. 
      They include <em>if-else, switch, for, while, and do-while</em>. 
      The <i>if-else</i> statement is used for decision-making. 
      The <mark>switch</mark> statement helps in handling multiple conditions easily. 
      Looping statements like <b>for</b> and <b>while</b> are used for repetition. 
      The <strong>break</strong> and <strong>continue</strong> keywords control loop flow. 
      Control statements increase the <u>flexibility and logic</u> of Java programs. 
      Without them, programs would only run in <em>linear order</em>.
