    <h1>Java Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      An <b>array</b> in Java is a <u>collection of similar data types</u> stored in a single variable. 
      Arrays can store multiple values like <i>numbers, strings, or objects</i>. 
      The index of an array starts from <mark>0</mark>. 
      Arrays provide a way to access elements using their index position. 
      Java supports both <em>single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays</em>. 
      Arrays are useful for <strong>storing and processing large data</strong>. 
      However, their size is fixed once declared. 
      For more flexibility, Java provides <b>ArrayList</b> and other collection classes.
