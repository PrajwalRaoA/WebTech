    <h1>Java Methods</h1>
    <p>
      In <b>Java</b>, methods are <u>blocks of code</u> designed to perform specific tasks. 
      A method has a <em>name, return type, parameters, and body</em>. 
      Methods make code more <i>modular and reusable</i>. 
      Java has both <mark>predefined methods</mark> (like length()) and user-defined methods. 
      Static methods belong to the class, while instance methods belong to objects. 
      Using methods helps reduce <strong>code duplication</strong>. 
      Methods also improve <b>readability</b> by organizing logic into smaller units. 
      They are a core concept of <u>object-oriented programming</u> in Java.
